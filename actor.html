        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> A remote allows you to connect your local repository to a shared repository hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.</li>
        <li><strong>Common Name:</strong> The default remote is often called <code>origin</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Uses:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Push your changes to the remote (upload).</li>
                <li>Pull changes from the remote (download).</li>
                <li>Collaborate with others.</li>

        Remote URL: <a href="https://github.com/user/repo.git" target="_blank">https://github.com/user/repo.git</a> <br>
